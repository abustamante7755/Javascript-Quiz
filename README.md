# Javascript-Quiz

i started by adding the questions i would ask the user 
        question: "Inside which HTML element do we put the JavaScript?"
        question: "Where is the correct place to insert a JavaScript?"
        question: "How do you create a function in JavaScript"
        question: "How can you add a comment in a JavaScript?"

after listing my questions, i built the system around them to choose individual answers 

i added the point counter system to try to keep track of how many correct and incorrect answer the user has gotten but i wasnt able to get it to work

i got stuck for a little tryint to get the page to change the question
